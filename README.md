# MineSweeper Console Game

The project allows you to play the old-school MineSweeper game known from the Windows system.

I created the game using object-oriented programming. That means cells are their own classes, and so are board and the game itself!

I am, however, tad ashamed that it is but a simple console version of the game. Granted, you do move around with your keyboard, which saves a lot of time compared to inserting coordinates, but I intend to one day develop this into a window application. Either way, I am proud of what I have done and ready to present you the project:



## How to Install
This being a console application, you need a coding software to open it, play it and work with it. It can be either as simple as Codeblocks or a paid option like CLion (which I created the game in).

Once you get your hands on one, simply download the repository on your computer and you're free to run it!

Alternatively, you could fork this repository and clone it onto your own device as well.
## How to Play
The rules are simple and unchanged compared to the classic Minesweeper. 

The game contains a board filled with 10 per 10 cells/fields. However, they are all hidden. Your objective is to reveal all of them, but watch out! Some of them contain mines, which you must avoid, lest you lsoe the game!

For the sake of convenience, the game contains an option to place a flag on a cell. That is more or less a cosmetic addition, but it helps you keep track of where you believe the mines may be.

The game ends either when you reveal all of the empty cells (win) or when you try to reveal any of the mines (loss).
